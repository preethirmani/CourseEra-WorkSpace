<h1>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h1>
<h2>CSS Rule <h2>
<p>The CSS syntax consists of a set of rules. These rules have 3 parts: a selector, a property, and a value.You don't need to remember this in order to code CSS. Once you start coding CSS, you'll do so without thinking "this is a selector" or "that is a property".</p>
<h2>Heading2</h2>
<p>Each of them makes it easy for the browser to parse and understand your CSS code: The curly braces allow you to group several properties into the same rule.</p>
